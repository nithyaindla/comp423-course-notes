If you use packages but don't track which version you're using, your code could break if a new version of a package is released. go mod keeps everything organized and ensures you're using the right versions. When you start a Go project, you run go mod init &lt;\"module-name\"&gt;. This creates a file called go.mod, which is like the table of contents for your project. It lists the packages your project uses and the versions of those packages.</p> <p>The two main commands: go mod init &lt;\"module-name\"&gt;: Initializes a new module for your project. go mod tidy: Cleans up your module by removing any unused packages or dependencies.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#running-and-testing","title":"Running and Testing","text":"<ol> <li>Add a main.go file <code>code main.go</code></li> <li>Add the following to the file:</li> </ol> <pre><code>package main \nimport \"fmt\" \n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello COMP426\")\n}\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Enter the following:  <pre><code>go build\n</code></pre></li> </ol> <p>What is go build?</p> <p>\"go build\" is a command in Go (Golang) that compiles your Go source code into an executable binary.
