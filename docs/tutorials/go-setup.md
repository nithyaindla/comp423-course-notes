##__Admonitions__, also known as call-outs, are an excellent choice for including side content without significantly interrupting the document flow.##

!!! note
    Admonitions follow a simple syntax: a block starts with !!!, followed by a single keyword used as a type qualifier. The content of the block follows on the next line, indented by four spaces.

##__Code blocks__ are an essential part of technical project documentation##

###Code blocks must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks. To add syntax highlighting to those blocks, add the language shortcode directly after the opening block.###

``` py title="codeblocks.py"
def Hello World():
    print("Hello World")
```
